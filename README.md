# An optimum multi-level image thresholding segmentation using non-local means 2D histogram and exponential Kbest gravitational search algorithm

The paper presents a novel two-dimensional (2D) histogram-based segmentation method for efficient multi-level image thresholding segmentation. The proposed method includes:
- A new non-local means based 2D histogram,
- A novel variant of gravitational search algorithm (exponential Kbest gravitational search algorithm), and 
- A 2D RÃ©nyi entropy is redefined. 

Experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed method through subjective and objective evaluation of
the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark (BSDS300)
